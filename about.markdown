Hiya! My name is Andrei Polukhin and this blog is about ... me :D

I want to tell my readers different sides of being a human, as emotional,
intellectual and conflicted as I am. I was born in Kyiv and had to leave my
country due to the war, finally finding my new home in Vienna.
I have been working as a software engineer since 17 yo, but I have realised
that I am more interested in people than computers, so I have decided to undergo psychoanalysis.
My posts will show the conclusions from the journey towards and inside of myself,
without religious adherence to any psychotherapeutic modality and with wider philosophical
reflections.

I am alike all of us, and I want to show it. My posts will give the reader a deep look into my soul.
We can start our acquaintanceship with this quote:

> "It is a joy to be hidden and a disaster not to be found." - Donald Winnicott.
