I am lying in my bed, facing the mirror. My cheeks are red, heart quickly pumping.
It is near midnight, so I can allow myself to feel more vulnerable, less guarded ...
I am thinking about her and I notice how my fingers start shaking, my eyes move away
not to see my own reflection. Which *her*? Is she the one whose love
will again demand performance? How different is this woman from the judgement
in my fingers? The inner child whispers poignantly:
"How much unconditional love still starves inside me?"

I have always craved women who *knew* what they wanted — and how to take this from me.
Ms A became no exception. Slightly elder than me, she became my teacher and I could not
stop fantasising about her energetic personality and praise for my skills. Her eye caught
my starving joy — how I cheered up under recognition, making my parents happy for A+'s.
Every sentence she said was a juxtaposition of how her petite physique contained something
devoted, even dangerous in effect. The choice of enigmatic black colour with red manicure
was her style, style which commanded, commanded learners to submit. Did I want her to heal
my wounds or grade my performance? Her pinning down my mistakes — thirst for being
*pinned down* or being judged for who I was?

I wanted to feel Ms A's domination with my senses. Her perfume was my baptism
into her world. When she walked beside me in group exercises, I inhaled her scent
like a vow: *this is how devotion smells*. She once mentioned that people in Vienna
often do not use deodorant, so I got self-conscious to the extent I once
asked my fellow student: "Do I smell?". Ms A burst into laughter, while I remained
grappling with my attraction towards her.

Idealising people is how we erase them. My analytical mind was aware of my
relational wounds and wanted to get a comprehensive look at Ms A's personality —
she seems sensitive to the topic of acceptance and has hysterical traits. For
a moment, I thought that perhaps she also felt loved for being a smart girl
in her childhood, and now needs encouragement for her work. It was relieving
to realise that none of us is perfect, yet what is more important is realising
your projections. Ms A is not my "project", nor am I. Is there a line between
an erotic fantasy and objectification?

Empathising further with her, I realised the professional aspect of my teacher's
position, namely, pedagogical ethics. If she were the woman I admire, I would not
harm her with any actions, even if she decides not to pursue any relationship
with me. Ms A has a career, so a mature lover understands that unfulfilled
libidinal impulses are less distressing than the well-being of a loved person.
Consensual relationship based on respect and care? *May* be possible.
Violating boundaries? **Never.**

My psychoanalyst once shared this nugget of wisdom:
> If any person makes you feel very strong emotions, this is rarely
> a good sign — most often, this shows a problematic area in the psyche.

With the scrutiny of an archaeologist, I looked inside to find the answer to
my feelings. What is it that I find attractive in women in power?

Wise unconsciousness showed me the scene from my childhood. I was six years old,
about to graduate from kindergarten. Being naturally inward-looking, I did
not spend much time socialising with my peers — except for two girls in my group.
It came as a shock to me when my parents told me that my kindergarten teacher
marked me as problematic in the "behavioural characteristics" for the primary school.
My parents were bringing the presents (= "bribes") to the teacher and the
principal so that they would write that I am socialised or, put it straight,
*like other kids*.

One particular memory still lingers in my mind. It was a
rainy autumn evening and I was returning from the kindergarten with both of my
parents. My mother was telling my father how fed up she felt pretending these
fake smiles, giving numerous presents, just to get adequate "characteristics".
This was her precise question to me, translated to English:
> Why cannot you be <u>normal</u>, like other kids?

This phrase, in essence, shows how I perceived important women in my childhood:
kindergarten/school teachers and, most importantly, my mother — *judges*, not
supportive figures. These women held the power to declare me normal — which meant,
of course, lovable. My eroticised attachment to Ms A shows how badly I need a
teacher to tell me *"You are loved for who you are"*.

Here comes a popular question in psychoanalysis: *"What should I do?"*. I have
to admit that I do not possess an "idealistic" outlook on self-understanding
or "working-through" as the ultimate cure for all psychological problems. We
all have traumas, the real question is *"How strong is their effect on a person?"*.
Enriched by understanding, I can understand *why* I need this recognition as
well as the simple fact that I am no longer a six-year-old boy. Likewise,
Ms A is not a kindergarten teacher — just a person with her psychological
configuration, who happens to know the skill I wish to learn.

Judges continue existing in my head, but I feel less driven by the terror to
perform. In the end, we are all vulnerable people functioning in this world.
Respect for another person and yourself — these are the indicators of "health".
"Health" can never be absolute, as we are too contradictory creatures.
Perhaps the answer lies not in handling contradictions, but in holding them?
