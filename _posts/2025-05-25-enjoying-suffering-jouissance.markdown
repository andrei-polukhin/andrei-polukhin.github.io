I'm typing this essay in a cafe, surrounded by a group of writers. The room
hums with chatter, so I've got my AirPods on, my left hand on a cup of cappuccino,
the other tapping the keyboard. I should feel grateful someone organised this Meetup
for amateur writers like me. Yet Ms K, the organiser, shows a disengaged, I-don't-care
attitude. I won't come back next week.

The thought *"I don't want this, so I won't do it"* still feels like a miracle for me.
For most of my life, I've been like a jester entertaining kings who could never truly
understand me. Looking back at the self-created stage, I wonder, *"Why? Is that what I wanted?"*.

I enjoy suffering. This sounds unhinged, but I'm not alone — just more honest than most.
When walking through parks and talking to myself, I trace it all back to the first time
I had *no other choice* than to enjoy the pain: my birth. All the following upbringing
has also been a (more or less) successful adjustment to the conditions of living
with my parents. I still often adjust to them — in my inner world.

My day-to-day life sometimes feels like a fight with paranoia. When attending an A1.1
German course in the best language school in Vienna, I felt primal fear at *mein Lehrer*'s gaze:
one mistake — and I get beaten. Old wounds don't care about new contexts. My eye twitched,
my shoulders shook — *Verhandlung mit meine Paranoia*:
> A: I can walk away. This isn't childhood.    
> P: Aber das Leiden ist deine Muttersprache! Du hast viel Spaß, oder?    
> A: Nein!

The ghost of my father wins again. *"Auf Wiedersehen!"* from our teacher, warm Viennese wind ...
Waiting for the U-Bahn, my analytical mind questions me:
*"Why do I still bear this cross inside of my soul? Recalling this again after so many years ..."*.
Only then did I realise: these hardcore study sessions were the closest thing we had together.

Children do not want pain — they long for love from their parents. Nor do they know what affection
is until they experience it — the *inevitability of enjoyment*, or what Lacan calls "jouissance".
Masochism is not about getting off from suffering — more about getting off from the *person*
who makes us suffer. Realising this "adhesion" was the first time I saw the cage. Later came
the decision: pleasure **myself**, not the ghosts.

It was amidst the crisis with Ms M — her sterile scalpel and pushy authority — that I realised
how much I needed *another* kind of love. Not the kind that demands "performance", but which
develops on its own. Not the kind rooted in hyper-control, but based on care and attention.
Ultimately, the one making *me* feel safe. The answer was always there: grow flowers.

I called my orchid Rose — after the flower in "The Little Prince" that learns love isn't about
being "special", but rather being chosen. This particular quote lingers in my mind:
> There might be millions of roses in the whole world, but you're my only one, unique rose.

I got increasingly anxious when several of Rose's buds withered. Was my love not enough?
Was I narrow-minded to see just a *Phalaenopsis hybride* and not Rose in my pot?

This is *komisch* to admit to my readers, but I didn't invent anything better than talking with
my orchid. I also remained consistent in my care towards her, keeping a keen eye on her roots to know
what she needs. Rose told me when to water her by turning her roots into the silver colour, which
I found more trustworthy than following some hard-coded "rules". Two months later, she blossomed
again. Was I finally listening to my own roots as well?

There was another discomfort I couldn't shake — accepting people being different. My deep sensitivity
takes rejection as a childhood tribunal: *"What have I done wrong?"*. The solution arrived naturally:
an *Anthurium clarinervium* called Igor, whose needs have no resemblance with Rose's. She craves sun —
he loves shade. She blossoms often — he grows slowly. She loves shower watering — he may die if watered
excessively. The difference doesn't feel like a failure — just life.

This post is shorter than previous ones and not as polished — it needn't be. Flowers feel when you care
about them and even if you skip several days of watering — c'est la vie :)
